                  <p> ICU© mobile monitoring software is the best choice to watch over your kids, family, friends and supervising employees' performance. It allows you to track anything on the target device. You can have access to their call log history, live GPS location, text messeges, and our most popular feature "Smart Control". 
                      ICU can also be used as an emergency tool. If you happen to break your phone and have no access to your messeges or voice mail you could target your own phone number and read them on your computer or tablet.

Their saftey is my  primary concern so I've been using this application on my phone to take a look where my kids are when I am not around and also check their messeges and calls just in case they're not being bullied by someone at school.
